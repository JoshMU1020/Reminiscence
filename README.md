# **Reminiscence**

## **Insperation:**
This project was inspired by our team's CMPSC 472 Operating Systems course. We were tasked as our final project, to create a software application that would provide happiness to the elderly. The contents of this repository are the result of our interpretation of this prompt.


## **Project Overview:**
Reminiscence is an application aimed at providing the elderly with a way to organize data related to their past memories. The software is designed to be a scrapbook-like application that would allow users to create notes and upload images to the software which can then be organized into a collage that is then saved to a scroll view of those collages. The application can be used to store, organize, retrieve, and display memories in the form of photos and notes. The software will showcase a friendly user interface for accessing these operations while utilizing our course-related concepts to ensure smooth management of the functions required to manipulate this memory data. Concepts like threading ~~TAKE OUT LATER IF NOT IMLEMENTED~~ and process synchronization can be used to ensure smooth transitions from data like photo scrolling. Other concepts related to file management can be used in managing stored data for quick retrieval. All together, Reminiscence will be able to provide the elderly with a way to construct a virtual scrapbook to create a personalized journey through their past memories.


## **Software Features:**

### Provide users with a way to:
- Upload memory data including Notes and Images.
- Allow users to browse their uploaded media by choosing where to place these data items on a GUI canvas.
  - Saves these canvas pages for later viewing.
- Provide the user with a User-Friendly GUI for them to traverse through the application.

## **Technology Stack:**
**As of the current date, our tech stack includes:**

**Coding Language:** Python

**GUI Tool:** Kivy
- Kivy’s TextInput Widget: Handles creating and editing text-based notes.
- Kivy’s Image Widget: Supports features related to manipulation of images.
- Kivy’s DropFile Widget: Supports drag and drop of files into GUI for a more GUI-friendly environment.

**File Manuvering and Storage:** 
- Python OS Module:
- Python Threading Module ~~TAKE OUT LATER IF NOT IMLEMENTED~~


## **Code Structure:**
- Present a systematic diagram of the code's structure and explanations for easy understanding.
