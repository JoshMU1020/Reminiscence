# **Reminiscence**

## **Insperation:**
This project was inspired by our team's CMPSC 472 Operating Systems course. We were tasked as our final project, to create a software application that would provide happiness to the elderly. The contents of this repository is the result of our interpretation of this prompt.


## **Project Overview:**
Reminiscence is an application aimmed at providing the elderly with a way to organize data related to their past memories. The software is designed to be a scrapbook-like application that would allows users to create notes and upload images, audio files, or videos to the software which can then be organized to the specifications of the user. The application can be used to store, organize, retrieve, and display memories in the form of photos, recordings, notes, etc. The software will showcase a friendly user interface for accessing these operations while utilizing our course-related concepts to ensure smooth management of the functions required to manipulate this memory data. Aside from the main scrapbook, Reminiscence can provide features like a photo album or an interactive timeline as ways to display the given data of a user. Concepts like threading and process synchronization can be used to ensure smooth transitions from data like photo scrolling. Other concepts related to file management can be used in managing stored data for quick retrieval. All together, Reminiscence will be able to provide the elderly with a way to construct a virtual scrapbook to create a personalized journey through their past memories.
